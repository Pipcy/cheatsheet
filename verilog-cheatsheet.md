# Verilog Review for Programmers

This cheat sheet covers basic Verilog for hardware design, as presented in the notebook.

## Background & Overview
ASICs - application specific, baked in, custom designed, for single purpose, cheaper for mass production
FPGAs - Programmable chips, for multiple purposes/design/prototypes, expensive for mass production
Both works with verilog code.
### Terminology
- **Structural Description** (Netlist/Gatelevel/transistor level) - detail to gates
- **Behavioral Description** - Describe functionality without gate specification (looks like c)
- **Testing description** designed for simulation
- HDLs (Verilog, VHDL)
